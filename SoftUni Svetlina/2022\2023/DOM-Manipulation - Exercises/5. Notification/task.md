Write a JS function that receives a string message and displays it inside a div with id "notification" for 2
seconds. The div starts hidden and when the function is called, reveal it. After 2 seconds, hide the div. In
the example document, a notification is shown when you click the button.
When we click the “Get notified” button a div appears in our upper‐right corner. It should disappear in 2
seconds.
