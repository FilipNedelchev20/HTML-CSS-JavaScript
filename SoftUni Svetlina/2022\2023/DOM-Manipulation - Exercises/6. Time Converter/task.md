Create a JS app to convert between diferent time units. Your task is to add a click event listener to all
buttons. When a button is clicked, read the corresponding input field and convert the value to the three
other units of time and display it in the input fields.
One day is equal to 24 hours/1440 minutes/86400 seconds. Whichever button we click, the input fields
should change depending on the added value on the left. (If we make it 48 hours and click convert the
days, field should change to 2 and etc.).
