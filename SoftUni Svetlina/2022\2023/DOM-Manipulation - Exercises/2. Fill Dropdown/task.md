Your task is to take values from input fields with id’s “newItemText” and “newItemValue” and create and
append an <option> to the <select> with id “menu”.
  
Hints:
 Your function should take the values of newItemText and newItemValue. After that you should
create a new option element and set it’s textContent and it’s value to the newly taken ones.
 Once you have done all of that you should append the newly created option as a child to the select
item with id “menu”.
 Finally you should clear the value of the two input fields.
