Write a JS function to highlight the currently active section of a document. There will be multiple divs with
inputs inside them â€“ set the class of the div, that contains the currently focused input field to "focus".
When focus is lost (blurred) remove the class from the element.

Input/Output:
There will be no input/output, your program should instead modify the DOM of the given HTML
document.
