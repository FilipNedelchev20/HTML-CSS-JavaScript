Write a JS program that implements a web timer that supports minutes and seconds. The user should be
able to control it with buttons. Clicking [Start] resets the timer back to zero. Only one of the buttons
should be enabled at a time (you cannot stop the timer, if itâ€™s not running).

Input/Output:
There will be no input/output, your program should instead modify the DOM of the given HTML
document.
