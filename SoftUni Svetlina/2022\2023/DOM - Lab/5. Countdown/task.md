Write a JS program that implements a web countdown timer that supports minutes and seconds. The user
should be able to set the time by calling Ð° function with the number of seconds required. The time begins
to count down as soon as the function is called. Using the sample code, your function will be called as soon
as the page finishes loading and will begin to count down from 10 minutes.

Input:
Your function will receive a number parameter, representing the starting number of seconds.

Output:
There will be no output, your program should instead modify the DOM of the given HTML document.
