You are given a number X, Y and Z. Create a function that finds if X * Y * Z (the product) is negative or positive. Try
to do this WITHOUT multiplying the 3 numbers.

Hint:
 Count the negative numbers. If they are odd number, the result will be negative, otherwise  positive.
 Special case: one of the numbers is 0  the product is positive.
